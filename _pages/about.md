This site is a work in progress, and will be completed very soon.

Any information here, except my [CV](https://kpgoik.github.io/cv/) is inaccurate and should be **entirely disregarded**. The only reason this page is active is to make for easier prototyping testing of Github pages on mobile and desktop.

For now, feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:kpgoik@gmail.com). Thanks!
